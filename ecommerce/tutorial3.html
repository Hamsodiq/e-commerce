            <h1>Shop Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <h3>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR SALE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</h3>
            
            Definitions & Interpretation<br><br><br>
    
            In the following Terms and Conditions of sale, unless the context requires otherwise<br><br><br>
    
            (a) "Shop" means Shop Pty Ltd ABN 11 222 333 444;<br>
            (b) "Customer" means the person or corporation placing an order for the purchase of goods or services from Shop;<br>
            (c) "Products" means any goods, materials, equipment or services provided to the Customer by Shop;<br>
            (d) if the Customer comprises more than one person, each of those person’s liability is joint and several;<br>
            (e) references to a party or a person includes any form of entity and their respective successors, assigns and representatives;<br> 
            (f) for all periods and times specified in clauses 5 and 11, time is of the essence; and<br>
            (g) all references to currency are references to Australian dollars.<br><br> 
    
            <b>General</b><br><br>
    
            By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop, the Customer agrees that it is bound by these<br> Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The<br> acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and<br> Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves<br> the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by the Customer will constitute an acceptance<br> of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer<br> has no right to cancel or vary the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.<br><br>
    
            <b>Quotations</b><br><br>
    
            Any quotation by Shop to the Customer will be open for acceptance by the Customer within the period stated in the quotation or,<br>where no period is stated, within seven (7) days from the date of the quotation. Thereafter, prices stated in the quotation may be<br> varied by Shop without notice to the Customer.<br><br>
    
            <b>Prices / Taxes</b><br><br>
    
            The prices charged by and payable to Shop will be the ruling prices applicable at the time of order placement, provided that the<br> Products are accepted for delivery within a reasonable time. Prices are subject to change without notice. Recommended retail<br> prices are provided for indicative purposes only and there is no obligation for Shop to comply with that recommendation. It as<br> agreed that should the Customer fail for any reason to acquire the quantity of Products sold then without limiting Shop' other rights<br> and remedies the unit price charged for the goods sold may be amended to take into account any variation in the total quantity<br> purchased by the Customer. Prices include GST, but do not include any other tax or duty, which is in addition to the price and is to<br> be paid by the Customer at the time of payment for the Products.<br><br>
    
            <b>Terms of Payment</b><br><br>
    
            Credit Card Payments may attract a surcharge, and Shop will inform the Customer if this is to be the case before processing the<br> transaction.<br><br>
    
            Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Shop, where Shop has not agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer,<br> the total purchase price for Products supplied will be due for payment in cash prior to delivery.<br><br>
    
            Where Shop has agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer, the Customer must make payments in<br> accordance with the payment terms provided by Shop.<br><br>
    
            Where Shop has approved the provision of a commercial credit arrangement with the Customer but has not provided notice of the<br> payment terms to the Customer, the Customer must pay the total purchase price for Products supplied within seven days of the<br> statement date.<br><br>
    
            Credit Card Payment at an Invoice or transaction level may also be offered to the Customer as a stand-alone payment method, or<br> in conjunction with Credit Card Direct Debit Authorisation.<br><br>
    
            <b>Credit Accounts</b><br><br>
    
            Any commercial credit arrangements that are provided to the Customer by Shop will continue until terminated by Shop at it sole<br> discretion. In the event that Shop terminates the Customer's commercial credit arrangement, the Customer will be notified in<br> writing and termination will take effect upon receipt of that notification by the Customer.<br><br>
            
            <b>Change of Ownership</b><br><br>
    
            Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the representations made by the Customer. In the<br> event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether total or partial, the Customer must immediately provide written<br> notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer of a change in ownership,<br> the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds Shop indemnified against any and<br> all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs, charges, fees and expenses incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any<br> person, company (including the same company but with a different shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a trust)<br> which may have purchased the Customer's business or any interest in the Customer's business or any of the shares in the<br> Customer and used the Customer's previously approved account for trading.<br><br>
    
            Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct Debit, the Customer must provide<br> notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in ownership of the business to allow Shop sufficient time to contact the<br> new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card information if applicable.<br><br>
            
            <b>Information on the Products supplied</b><br><br>
    
            All descriptive specifications, illustrations, drawings, data, dimensions and weights furnished by Shop or otherwise contained in<br> catalogues or other advertising material are approximate only and are intended to be merely a general description of the goods,<br> are not incorporated within this agreement and no not form part of the description of the goods sold under this or any other<br> agreement unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Shop in which case such information will be subject to recognised trade<br> tolerances.<br><br>
            
            <b>Delivery</b><br><br>
    
            The means of delivering the Products to the Customer will be at Shop' discretion. Shop reserves the right to deliver Products in part<br> deliveries. In the event that Shop incurs additional costs for meeting special (i.e. Tasmania / Northern Territory Deliveries) or urgent<br> delivery arrangements, these additional costs may be charged to the Customer and may include the cost of airfreight where it is<br> not the normal method of delivery. The Customer agrees to accept delivery of the Products sold at any time during normal<br> business hours.<br><Br>
    
            Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any late delivery of the Products and late delivery will not entitle the<br> Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's order for the Products.
